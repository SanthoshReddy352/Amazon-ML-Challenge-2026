## Approach at a glance
Blocking (union of exact keys + rare tokens + TF-IDF char kNN + multilingual embedding kNN + reverse kNN) → **LightGBM pairwise matcher** on similarity features → optional multilingual cross-encoder re-ranker (MIT/Apache, ≤ 8B params) → decision layer (calibration, one-S1-per-record assignment, expected-F0.5 subset selection, singleton handling).
Compute: laptop for EDA on samples; **AWS S3 + EC2** (r7i.8xlarge CPU, g5.2xlarge Spot GPU) for full scale; Kaggle/Colab GPU as the fallback.

## Step 0: Setup & infrastructure
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | Project layout (`code/business_entity_resolution/src`, `notebooks/`, `artifacts/`, `output/`) + `git init` | DONE | Layout created in submission structure; `.gitignore` excludes data/artifacts/.venv; git initialised (commit 0035fa0) |
| 0.2 | Python 3.11 venv + pinned requirements (polars, pyarrow, pandas, rapidfuzz, scikit-learn, lightgbm, faiss-cpu, sentence-transformers, torch, anyascii, jellyfish, boto3) | DONE | `.venv` (uv, CPython 3.11.15) at project root; pinned versions in `code/business_entity_resolution/requirements.txt` (torch 2.14 CPU build) |
| 0.3 | Install AWS CLI v2 | DONE | AWS CLI 2.37.1 at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Amazon\AWSCLIV2` (already on user PATH; open a new terminal). Verified as `user/tricky` |
| 0.4 | File quota increases: EC2 On-Demand Standard → 64 vCPU; On-Demand G/VT → 8; G/VT Spot → 8 | SKIPPED | Both quota requests denied (account on AWS Free plan). **User decision 25 Sep: stay on the Free plan**, so no EC2 compute |
| 0.5 | AWS Budgets alerts ($40/$80/$120/$150) + tag `project=amlc2026` | DONE | Budget `amlc2026-credits` ($160, excludes credits so real burn is tracked); email alerts at $40/80/120/150 → gsreddy1182006@gmail.com |
| 0.6 | Create S3 bucket `amlc2026-856608368454` (ap-south-1); upload raw TSVs to `raw/` | DONE | Bucket `amlc2026-856608368454` (ap-south-1, private, tagged). `raw/` = 10 files / 2.4 GB (verified). `processed/` + `normalized/` backup upload running |
| 0.7 | Convert TSVs to parquet → `processed/` | DONE | `src/data.py` → `artifacts/processed/*.parquet` (zstd, 1.0 GB, 13 s) + `train_gt_pairs.parquet` (7.76M rows, exploded). S3 copy to `processed/` after the raw upload |
| 0.8 | Launch EC2 CPU box (r7i.8xlarge) + idle auto-stop alarm | SKIPPED | Free plan only allows Free-Tier instances. `infra/ec2_worker.py` kept for reference; the IAM role `amlc2026-ec2-worker` and SG `amlc2026-worker-sg` exist (no cost). **Compute = laptop (16 GB, 12 threads)** |
| 0.9 | GPU: g5.2xlarge Spot **or** Kaggle/Colab fallback ready | DONE | AWS GPU denied → **Kaggle** is the GPU path. Kaggle CLI 2.2.4 in .venv; user stored the token at `~/.kaggle/access_token` (auth verified 25 Sep 07:05) |

## Step 1: Understand problem & rules
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Read problem statement | DONE | For each S1, list all matching S2/S3 IDs (0..n). S1 is deduplicated. |
| 1.2 | Understand the metric | DONE | Macro F0.5 per S1. Singleton: empty prediction → 1.0, anything else → 0.0. Implementation in 4.3 |
| 1.3 | Submission + validator rules | DONE | Two TSVs; one row per test S1; S2/S3 IDs only; no dupes; matches ⊆ candidates; `utils/validate_submission.py` |
| 1.4 | Compliance checklist | DONE | No external lookups/geocoding/internet data; model MIT/Apache ≤ 8B; reproducible zip; `country` is an open set |

## Step 2: Explore dataset (EDA)
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Schema, sizes, nulls, duplicates | DONE | No duplicate entity_ids. S2/S3 have ~0.4–0.5% exact duplicate (name, addr, country) rows; S1 has none. Names never empty; S2/S3 addresses 2.7–3.4% empty |
| 2.2 | Country & source distributions | DONE | Train: US ~60%, India ~40%. Test adds **France** (S1 15%, S2/S3 ~14%) |
| 2.3 | Match-count distribution & singletons | DONE | Singletons 5.6%. Mode 3 matches; 0–11 range. Mean 1.67 S2 + 1.79 S3 per S1. ~2.7M S2/S3 distractors |
| 2.4 | Does each S2/S3 record map to ≤ 1 S1? | DONE | **YES**: all 7,638,365 matched S2/S3 ids map to exactly 1 S1. 26% of S2/S3 (2.68M) are unmatched distractors → assignment constraint valid |
| 2.5 | Do matches always share the `country` value? | DONE | **YES**: 100% of pairs share country (US–US 4.58M, India–India 3.06M) → partition blocking by country |
| 2.6 | Name noise catalogue | DONE | Permutations, OCR typos, accents, suffix swaps, appended descriptors, domain names (~4%), junk prefixes (~2–3%), alias constructions (D.B.A., t/a, formerly known as), native-script names, zero-width chars. See `docs/eda_findings.md` |
| 2.7 | Address noise catalogue | DONE | Reordering, dropped/altered house numbers, city swaps, NULL/PMB/PO Box injection, state abbreviation/full/native script. **Postcodes rare** (ZIP ~10% US, PIN ~0% India) → not a primary key |
| 2.8 | S2 vs S3 style differences | DONE | S2: US addresses 90% UPPERCASE with USPS abbreviations; more native script (India 41%). S3: full state names, title case, native script 33% (India) |
| 2.9 | Encoding & script inventory | DONE | Clean UTF-8. Indic scripts: Devanagari ≫ Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Gujarati, Bengali, Malayalam, Oriya, Gurmukhi. Zero-width chars ~1%. French: accents, °/º, ’ |
| 2.10 | France test profile (unlabelled) | DONE | 3 regions / ~10 cities → huge city blocks; generic names (Club, Amicale, SARL…). S1 uses region, S2/S3 use department → need a department↔region map. Abbreviations R./AV/ALL/BD |
| 2.11 | Similarity of true matches vs random pairs | DONE | Sample of 60k: true name token-set median 95–100 vs random 33–38; address 93–97 vs 36–38. **Hard negatives are the issue**: 49% of S1 share a name key with another S1; 22% of distractors have an exact S1 name key |
| 2.12 | EDA findings summary (for Documentation §2.1) | DONE | Written to `docs/eda_findings.md` (feeds Documentation §2.1) |

## Step 3: Cleaning & normalisation
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Unicode NFKC, accent folding, transliteration (anyascii) | DONE | `src/normalize.py`: NFKC, zero-width strip, anyascii transliteration, lowercase. **Learned translit map** from 1.1M train pairs: 539 tokens (praivet→pvt, limitet→ltd, indstrijh→industries…) + 16 native-script states. Indic names now normalise to exactly the S1 name (p10 token-set = 100) |
| 3.2 | Junk / URL / domain stripping | DONE | Pipe/URL tails stripped; domains and hashtags → concatenated core (`name_is_domain`); junk prefixes removed; OCR digit→letter fix; alias split (D.B.A., t/a, formerly known as, aka) → `name_core` + `name_alt` |
| 3.3 | Legal-suffix dictionaries (US, India, France) | DONE | `src/dictionaries.py` LEGAL_CANON (US/IN/FR) → `name_legal`; `name_core` excludes legal tokens + stopwords; `name_key` (sorted tokens), `name_skel` (consonant skeleton) |
| 3.4 | Address abbreviation expansion (US / IN / FR) | DONE | Country-specific street maps (US/India/France: R→rue, AV→avenue, ALL→allee…); number-prefix tokens dropped (H.No, Door No, Unit…); NULL/PMB/PO Box removed |
| 3.5 | Parse postcode / PIN, house number, city, state | DONE | `addr_street`, `addr_localities`, `addr_nums`, `addr_house_no`, `addr_postcode`, `addr_empty`. Train true pairs: house number agrees 88% US / 76% India (Indian addresses have many numbers → use set overlap) |
| 3.6 | State name ↔ abbreviation maps (incl. native scripts) | DONE | US 50 states + DC; India states/UTs + aliases (+Keralam); France 13 regions + all departments → region. State found 100% US / 99.3% India; agrees 100% / 98.7% on true pairs. France: S1 100%; S2 66% (the rest genuinely have no state) |
| 3.7 | Unit tests on tricky examples | DONE | `tests/test_normalize.py`: 17 tests from real EDA examples; all pass. Full run: 22M records in 13.5 min (6 workers). Output `artifacts/normalized/*.parquet` |

## Step 4: Validation framework
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Group split by S1 (90/10), full S2/S3 pool kept as distractors | DONE | `src/split.py` → `artifacts/splits/split_v1.parquet`: 5 stratified folds (country × match-count), fold 0 = **val** (441,370 S1), 1–4 = **fit** (1,765,451); **dev** = 20k val subset. Singleton rate 5.59% in every part. **Blocking/features run over ALL train S1** (label-free); the split only selects whose labels fit vs score |
| 4.2 | Leave-one-country-out split (France proxy) | DONE | `split.subsets()`: `loco_India` (fit on US labels → score India val), `loco_US` (vice versa) |
| 4.3 | `evaluate.py`: macro F0.5, P, R, singleton accuracy | DONE | `src/evaluate.py`: exact macro F0.5 (singleton rule), macro/micro P/R, singleton accuracy, by-country breakdown; TSV read/write in submission format. Tests reproduce the README example = **0.714**; 23 tests pass |
| 4.4 | Blocking metrics: pair recall, entity recall ceiling, reduction ratio | DONE | `blocking_report()`: pair recall, entity full recall, **oracle F0.5 ceiling**, candidates per S1, reduction ratio, by country. Finding: exact name_key blocking → 28.6M pairs for val (Meridian = 1,725 records) with only 65.6% recall / 0.851 ceiling → name-only blocking unusable |
| 4.5 | Experiment log (`experiments.md`) | DONE | `artifacts/experiments.jsonl` → rendered to `docs/experiments.md`. References (dev): all-empty 0.055; exact name 0.467; +state 0.604; **+house no. 0.687 (P 0.98, R 0.48)** |

## Step 5: Blocking / candidate generation
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Country partitioning (if 2.5 confirms) | DONE | Blocking runs per `country` (EDA 2.5: 100% of pairs share country). Open set: any new country gets its own partition |
| 5.2 | Exact-key blocks (postcode + name token, house no. + street token) | DONE | Composite keys as tokens: `wl` name word|locality, `hs` house no.|street word, `hk` house no.|street skeleton, `nk` full name key |
| 5.3 | Rare-token inverted index on names | DONE | IDF-weighted token overlap via joins (`src/blocking.py`); tokens with df > 3000 dropped. Name tokens: word, skeleton, word pairs, concatenation, 5-grams for domain names |
| 5.4 | TF-IDF char n-gram kNN | SKIPPED | Replaced by the token-overlap scorer (sparse TF-IDF equivalent; 5-grams cover char-level concatenation). Revisit only if recall stalls |
| 5.5 | Multilingual embedding kNN (FAISS) | DONE | Kaggle `amlc2026-embed-knn` (private; 2×T4, multilingual-e5-small MIT): top-6 neighbours per S1 per source. Val pair recall: blocking 95.79% → **union 96.67%** (US 97.78%, India 95.01%), +6.4 cands/S1. Union dirs `blocking/union_{train,test}` (hard links + `<country>_knn.parquet`) |
| 5.6 | Reverse kNN (S2/S3 → S1) | SKIPPED | Covered by the across-S1 competition features (rev_*) computed over all candidates |
| 5.7 | Union + dedupe; tune K for ≥ 98% pair recall | DONE | Full train (2.2M S1) in 68 min on the laptop → `artifacts/blocking/cands_all_df3000_t20n10a10/` (~121M pairs, 1.9 GB, integer ids). **Val (441k S1): pair recall 95.79% (US 96.8%, India 94.2%), entity full recall 87.4%, oracle F0.5 0.9855, 54.5 cands/S1**. The ordinal canonicalisation fix gave +0.1pp |
| 5.8 | Optional cheap pre-ranker to cap candidates per S1 | TODO | |
| 5.9 | Write `candidate_pairs.tsv` (final model input) | DONE | Test blocking 42 min: **93.2M pairs**. France 259k S1 → 52.4/S1, India 810k → 53.5, US 663k → 54.8. `artifacts/blocking/cands_test_df3000_t20n10a10/`. candidate_pairs.tsv is written from it at submission time |

## Step 6: Baseline submission
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Rule / threshold baseline scored on validation | DONE | `src/baseline_rule.py`: name_key + house no. + compatible state, drop records claimed by >1 S1. **Val 0.6798** (P 0.989, R 0.467; US 0.727, India 0.610); dev 0.684 |
| 6.2 | Test run + validator PASS | DONE | Test: 2.93M pairs, 1.29M of 1.73M S1 non-empty. **Official validator PASS (with --check-ids)**. Empty rate France 19.6% / India 32.1% / US 20.0%; France has more matches per S1 (2.63 vs 2.15–2.25), a possible false-merge risk. Backed up to `s3://…/submissions/v0_baseline_rule/` |
| 6.3 | Upload to portal; record leaderboard score | DONE | Submitted 25 Sep 04:15 IST as **Team Bloom**: **public F0.5 0.680** (val 0.6798), so validation is well calibrated incl. France. Upload fix: Windows had no MIME type for .tsv, so the user set HKCU `.tsv` Content Type = text/tab-separated-values |

## Step 7: Feature engineering
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Name metrics: ratio, token set/sort, Jaro-Winkler, Jaccard, TF-IDF cosine, IDF-weighted overlap | DONE | Name fuzzy set (ratio / partial / token-sort / token-set / JW / concat), equality, Jaccard, length diffs. ~65k pairs/s on the laptop |
| 7.2 | Phonetic & acronym match | DONE | Skeleton token-set, alias-vs-core, legal-form eq/Jaccard/missing, domain/indic flags |
| 7.3 | Address component match (postcode, house no., street, city, state) | DONE | Address/street/locality similarity, state/house/postcode agreement (null = missing), number-set Jaccard/shared, empty flag |
| 7.4 | Embedding cosines (name, address, combined) | DONE | `knn_cos`, `knn_rank` on union candidates; stage-1 val 0.9704 → 0.9720 with them |
| 7.5 | Missingness flags; source flag (S2/S3) | DONE | Missing → null; `src` flag; country excluded |
| 7.6 | Context: rank within S1, gap to best, reverse rank, #candidates | DONE | Within-S1 relative scores + across-S1 competition (rev_n_s1, rev_is_best, rev_margin, rev_score_rel, rev_name_rel) from ALL candidates of the split |
| 7.7 | Group consistency: similarity to other strong candidates | DONE | **Stage-2 group consistency** (`src/stage2.py`): compare each candidate with the S1's 2 best other candidates (p1, name/skeleton/address/house agreement). Full val **0.9732** vs stage-1 0.9704 (+0.0028), P 0.9952, R 0.9347 |
| 7.8 | Feature importance + leakage check | DONE | Gain v1: **rev_margin 0.66**, rev_is_best 0.10, a_nums_jacc 0.065, rev_score_rel 0.02, a_street_tset 0.02, a_tok_jacc 0.02. No label leakage: rev/ctx features use only blocking scores (label-free) |

## Step 8: Matching model
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Build training pairs from train-split candidates (hard negatives) | DONE | Train = candidates of 200k random fit S1 (10.9M pairs, all negatives kept); valid = dev 20k (1.09M pairs) |
| 8.2 | LightGBM v1 | DONE | **LightGBM v1** (127 leaves, lr 0.08, 746 rounds, 4.7 min) + one-owner + thr 0.70: **dev F0.5 0.9706** (P 0.9937, R 0.9303; US 0.9752, India 0.9637; singleton acc 0.969). `artifacts/models/lgb_v1.txt` |
| 8.3 | Hyperparameter tuning | DONE | v2 full val **0.9710** @thr 0.70/0.75 (US 0.9762, IN 0.9631; crowded slice 0.9702). Expected-F0.5 / hybrid / name floor all ≤0.9705, so plain threshold kept |
| 8.4 | Probability calibration | SKIPPED | LightGBM logloss probabilities are well-behaved; the threshold curve is flat 0.65–0.80 |
| 8.5 | Leave-one-country-out robustness check | DONE | LOCO: US→India blind **0.9016** vs in-domain 0.9624 (−0.061); India→US blind 0.9623 vs 0.9756 (−0.013). Threshold re-tuning adds ≤0.01. The implied France score ≈0.93 exceeds the generic cost, pointing to the France-specific "several businesses at one address" false merges |

## Step 9: Decision layer / post-processing
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9.1 | Global threshold sweep for F0.5 | DONE | Main 0.75 / extension 0.7; flat 0.65–0.80; with test-like 2× distractor FPs the optimum stays 0.75–0.80 |
| 9.2 | One-S1-per-record assignment | DONE | `train.one_owner` over main + extension pairs jointly |
| 9.3 | Expected-F0.5 subset selection per entity | DONE | Expected-F0.5 prefix selection tested: best 0.9705 (temp 1.5) < threshold 0.9710; the model is already sharp. Kept for documentation |
| 9.4 | Singleton handling ("predict empty" option) | DONE | Singletons handled by threshold + one-owner (singleton acc 0.970 @0.75); expected-F empty option was worse (0.91–0.95) |
| 9.5 | Ablation of each component | DONE | Ablation (val): threshold 0.9710 > expected-F 0.9705 > hybrid 0.9699 > +name floor 40/50/60 0.9689/0.9679/0.9666 |

## Step 10: Neural components & ensemble
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | Compute embeddings on GPU (EC2 or Kaggle) | DONE | Embeddings on Kaggle GPU (24M texts, ~14 min per split on 2×T4); chunked fp16 + tiled exact top-k (fixes: __main__ guard, RAM OOM, GPU OOM) |
| 10.2 | Cross-encoder fine-tune (stretch goal) | DONE (v1) / IN PROGRESS (v2) | v1: xlm-roberta-base on 930k fit3/fit4 pairs, 1 epoch, dev logloss 0.1435; uncertain-band AUC 0.943 (v5f) → 0.947 (CE) → **0.973 blended**; val F0.5 +0.0033. v2 (`amlc2026-cross-encoder2`): 1.58M pairs, wider band [0.01, 0.999), different seed → ensemble |
| 10.3 | Blend / stack with LightGBM | DONE | `notebooks/ce_blend.py`: 5-fold by S1 on val band; richer blend (+17 pair features) only +0.00013 and uses France-shifted count features → kept the simple text-driven blend |
| 10.4 | Licence + parameter-count check | DONE | xlm-roberta-base: MIT licence, 278M params (≤ 8B); multilingual-e5-small: MIT, 118M; LightGBM: MIT |

## Step 11: France generalisation
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11.1 | French legal-form + address dictionaries | DONE | French legal forms, street types, department→region map in `dictionaries.py` |
| 11.2 | Country-agnostic feature audit | DONE | Crowd features were out-of-distribution for France (3× crowding) → **removed from v3** |
| 11.3 | Manual review of a sample of French predictions | DONE | LB simulator (`notebooks/lbsim.py`, validated on val: reproduces set differences ±0.0003) fitted to v1/v2/v3/v5c/probe. French pairs where submissions disagree are roughly correctly handled (v1-only pairs ≈45% true); French house-conflict picks are mostly true copies (house corrupted, same name/street). France's 0.04 deficit sits in pairs all submissions share (common errors or blocking misses); French name_score is IDF-depressed (82 vs 105) |
| 11.4 | Optional pseudo-labelling of high-confidence French pairs | TODO | |

## Step 12: Full-scale test inference & submissions
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12.1 | End-to-end run on EC2 | DONE | v3 test: union features 104M pairs → stage-2 → safeguard (rejected 185k French house-conflict pairs) → 5,679,374 pairs, 6.3% empty. France 7.0% empty / 3.42 per S1 (v1: 4.8% / 3.67); US/IN slightly more matches |
| 12.2 | Validator PASS | DONE | v3 matching_results.tsv **validator PASS (--check-ids)**; `submissions/v3u/` (+ `v3u_code.zip`); fallback no-kNN v3 in `submissions/v3/` |
| 12.3 | Submission log (see table below) | IN PROGRESS | v0 0.680, **v1 0.962** (dev 0.9706). Gap ≈ dev-threshold optimism + France: if US/IN ≈ 0.970 then France ≈ 0.91 → France is the biggest lever |

## Step 13: Error analysis & iteration
| # | Sub-step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13.1 | False-positive review | DONE | Val FPs 7.4k pairs, 95% are distractors. Distractor recipe (all countries): S1 name + extra word / swapped word / legal form change, **house number shifted +1..+21 on the same street**. Distractors are one-offs (1.6% share name+house with another record vs 55% of true copies) and almost never have an empty address (0.3%). Test has 5.76 records/S1 vs 4.67 train → ~2x distractors per S1 on test (precision drops vs val) |
| 13.2 | False-negative review | DONE | v3 val 0.9748: fix low-p in-candidate misses → 0.9834; remove all FPs → 0.9791; perfect within candidates → 0.9889. Half the low-p misses are empty-address records (97.7% of empty-address records are true matches; ambiguous when several S1 share the name). Blocking misses 50.9k (3.3%): many easy (same address + name typo) cut by the per-S1 top-k caps. No row-order / ID leaks. French house-number parse bug (postcodes '59200 Tourcoing', 'Appartement 406', '2eme etage') |
| 13.4 | Structural-pattern search (26 Sep, leader at 0.9905) | DONE | **No leaks**: IDs uniform/independent, raw TSV row order shuffled in train AND test (checked with v8 test preds). v8 val error split (fix-category-alone F0.5): empty-address non-exact-tie 25.2k missed (0.99176), empty-address identical-name ties 10.9k (0.98886, unresolvable: competing S1 have character-identical names; raw punctuation/legal form breaks only ~5k of 69k train ties; copy-count balancing ≈ chance), gibberish/translit names 8.5k (0.98837), house differs 5.9k (0.98804), other 3.7k, house missing 3.1k, domain 1.7k. Ceilings: perfect within candidates 0.99291; perfect on all non-empty + no FPs 0.99297; perfect except identical-name ties 0.99784. Record-first name assignment for unclaimed empty records: top-1 correct only 30% → every threshold lowers F0.5 (v6 idea stays dead). Gibberish misses: only 1.5k of 8.5k share an exact parsed street+locality with any S1 → needs fuzzy address blocking. Scripts in the session scratchpad (sep/cats/bound) |
| 13.5 | v9 second blocking extension (`notebooks/run_v9.py`, outputs only in `artifacts/v9/`) | STOPPED (low ceiling) | New keys house\|locality, vowel-skeleton street\|locality, house\|street-skeleton + v5 keys at max_df 100, top-10 by name+addr ∪ top-10 by addr. Val: 5.47M new pairs (12.4/S1), 5,079 true (0.09%) = 22% of non-empty misses. **Perfect model on them: +0.00107 val**; exact-address slice only 2.3% precise → realistic ≈ +0.0003, not worth a test run + CE time. Of the 17.6k non-empty blocking misses, 7k share no key at all and 6.7k share only keys dropped by top-k |
| 13.6 | France structural audit of v8 (unlabelled; per-class mix vs US/IN) | DONE (no actionable fix) | France per S1: v8 picks 3.32 (US 3.36), empty rows 5.6% (US 5.8%), pool 5.53 recs/S1 (US 5.76). Class mix differs but is explained by the DATA: same-house 3.02 vs US 2.39, house-differs 0.036 vs 0.28. France has few same-name/different-house candidates (0.057/S1 vs US 0.21), so these aren't missed copies. "All-new-name" excess (0.15 vs 0.08) = acronyms (AD, UF), gibberish rebrands, @handles/domains at the same house → true copies. Twins (same name+house+street) only 118 French S1. House parser OK on French formats (N°27, 86B, 34 Bis). Intrinsic: France has 1.7× more tied empty-address records (0.072 vs 0.042/S1, generic 'City + word' names). Validator allows one record under several S1 (not exploited: twins negligible) |
| 13.3 | Fixes + prioritised re-runs | IN PROGRESS | v4c refiner, v5c extension (LB 0.97423), v5d 5-fold (val 0.9825). Refiner hyper-params flat; learning curve +0.00027 per +50% data → building 440k fresh fit S1 (fit_sample3) as extra refiner data. France: 29% of French S1 share a name with another S1 in the same city, 6.5% share name+house (US 0%); French predicted count distribution ≈ truth while US sits below → France error is mostly wrong records, not missing ones. Decomposition probe `submissions/probe_fr_empty` (France rows empty) measures US/IN exactly |

## Decision log
| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 25 Sep | Hybrid: blocking + LightGBM + optional cross-encoder + F0.5 decision layer | Tabular pair matching favours GBDT; embeddings handle scripts/reorders; the decision layer optimises the exact metric |
| 25 Sep | EC2 (CPU + GPU Spot) + S3; Kaggle/Colab GPU fallback | SageMaker quotas are 0 and it costs more; EC2 is the simplest way to use the $160 |
| 25 Sep | Block by country; no postcode-based primary key; one-S1-per-record assignment | EDA 2.4/2.5/2.7 confirmed |
| 25 Sep | Learn native-script→Latin maps from train pairs (positional alignment) instead of hand-writing them | Covers 9 Indic scripts; derived only from training data (no external data) |
| 25 Sep | Validation: blocking/features over all train S1; split only selects labels for fit (80%) vs val (20%) + 20k dev; LOCO as France proxy | Keeps S1-vs-S1 competition for each record realistic, as on test |
| 25 Sep | GPU work moves to Kaggle; AWS GPU appeal filed at a reduced size | AWS denied the G/VT quota for this new account |
| 25 Sep | Stay on the AWS Free plan: S3 only; compute on laptop + Kaggle | User decision; avoids card billing beyond credits |
| 25 Sep | Every portal submission = matching_results.tsv + code zip (`submissions/vN_code.zip`) | The portal form needs both files to enable Submit & Evaluate |
| 25 Sep | Drop crowd features (France out-of-distribution); use LB probes that change ONLY France rows to test France hypotheses | v2 val +0.0007 but LB −0.011 |
| 25 Sep | No git commits by the assistant (user commits); max 5 submissions/day, no probes | User instruction |
| 25 Sep | Unseen-country safeguard: reject house-number conflicts for countries absent from training | v2 regression + v1 France pattern (1.5% conflicts) |
| 25 Sep | Treat France as a first-class target (country-agnostic features, French dictionaries, LOCO validation) | 15% of test S1, zero training labels |
